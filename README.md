# 3D-Motion-Animations

## About
This project was an exploration on 3D Motion Animation using Spline. We we're lucky enough to have a product developer from Spline walk us through the demo of creating interacting balls that can be moved around with the cursor. We were tasked with developing that and uploading it into a framer template. I however, really enjoyed playing around in Spline and deciced to create another animation as well that had interactive elements around a word (my name).

## Learnings
Through this process I learned not only how to create these interactive 3D elements to include into my future UX designs I also learned the value that they can bring to a design. Using Spline was definetly challenging at first but after going through the walk through demo and playing around with it my self I was able to get the grasp of it and look forward to expanding my skills with it to continue enhancing my design in UX and in general.
